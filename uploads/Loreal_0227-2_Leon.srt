1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Are there any free cosmetics for L'Oréal employees?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,360
We have so many free products

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,040
I haven't bought any products from L'Oréal

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,560
since I started my job

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,240
Today, we are going to interview

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,200
the L'Oréal office in Taiwan

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,959
Our office was renovated in 2002

8
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,920
There is a product wall here

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,280
If you are going on a date

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,280
but you forget to spray your perfume

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,639
the staff will come here to spray it

12
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,000
We also have our own cafe

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,959
There is also some salty food

14
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,200
such as beef noodles and dumplings

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,040
My favorite is our fruit box

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
What are the benefits of working at L'Oréal?

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,599
The working environment is free

18
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,880
You can work from home for a certain period of time every week

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,439
So I hope everyone can apply for this year's

00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,279
